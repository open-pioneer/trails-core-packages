# @open-pioneer/core

This package contains basic utility functions and classes used by the @open-pioneer project.

## Events

The package exports the `EventEmitter` class that supports emitting and subscribing to user defined events.

## Errors

The `Error` class extends JavaScript's global error class with a user defined `id` value that
can be used to explicitly identify error conditions.

```js
import { Error } from "@open-pioneer/core";
throw new Error("my-error:identifier", "This is the error message");
```

`Error` also exposes the optional `cause` attribute that allows nesting of error instances.
Note that browser support for that property is still required:

```js
import { Error, getErrorChain } from "@open-pioneer/core";

try {
    someFunctionThatCanThrow();
} catch (e) {
    throw new Error("my-error:higher-level-error-id", "Error text", { cause: e });
}

// getErrorChain gathers the error and all its causes (if any) into an array:
const errors = getErrorChain(error);
```

## Resources

The `Resource` type exported from this package is used by objects with a destructor.
All object needing some cleanup action to be called should use the `destroy` method for consistency and easier handling.

## Logger

The 'Logger' class provides a logger for standardized application wide logging.
The log level is configured globally in the vite.config.js.

To create a logger instance, call the `createLogger` method.
It takes a prefix (string) to prepend to each message.
Use `:` as a separator to encode hierarchical names (e.g. `"some-package:SomeClass"`).

The logger provides log methods for the following log levels with the following order: DEBUG < INFO < WARN < ERROR.

For example (as class attribute):

```ts
import { createLogger, Logger } from "@open-pioneer/core";

export class LoggerTestExample {
    private logger: Logger;
    constructor() {
        this.logger = createLogger("example-package:LoggerTestExample");
    }

    testMethod() {
        this.logger.warn("example message", { testLog: 123, text: "this is a text" });
    }
}
```

Or as a shared logger at module scope:

```ts
import { createLogger } from "@open-pioneer/core";
const LOG = createLogger("example-package");
```
