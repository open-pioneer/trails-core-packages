      This example demonstrates an app that supports multiple languages.
      The app's actual language can be inferred from the user's environment (browser language) or by
      explicitly forcing the locale during application start.
    open: "Open dialog"

  picker:
    choose: "Select a language:"
    default: "automatic (default)"
